# Test-strategy

In software testing, a test strategy is a high-level document or artifact that outlines the overall approach and plan for testing a software system or application. It provides guidelines and objectives for the testing activities to be performed throughout the project lifecycle. A test plan is a detailed document that outlines the approach, objectives, scope, and activities to be carried out in testing a software system or application. It serves as a roadmap or guide for the testing process, providing a comprehensive view of the testing strategy and execution.

This repository stores 2 types of test documentation: a short version of test plan and a test strategy. The project for which these types of documentation were developed is conditional. This is a mobile application for sharing pictures of cats.
